# Kartikey Sharma's site

This site is based on the **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** theme, a two-column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog. I forked this repository from the website of **[David Mart√≠nez-Rubio](https://damaru2.github.io/)**
